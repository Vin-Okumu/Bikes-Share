# Bikes Share Visualization
In this hypothetical scenario, I take on the role of a data analyst working on the marketing team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success
depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the underlying task is to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes diŦferently, with the insights expected to be used to
hel the marketing team to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
