## üö≤ Bikes Share Visualization üìä
In this hypothetical scenario, I take on the role of a data analyst working on the marketing team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company‚Äôs future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, the underlying task is to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes di≈¶ferently, the insights expected to helP the marketing team design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. 

The dataset used for this analysis and visualization is hosted on [divvy bikes](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) website, the exact dataset accessible [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/202502-divvy-tripdata.zip)

## üìù SQL Code
üëâ With the data, you can run the following SQl code block that I used

```sql
USE bikes_share_db;

SELECT 
   ride_id,
   rideable_type,  
   member_casual,
   TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, started_at, ended_at) AS ride_duration,
   CASE
     WHEN TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, started_at, ended_at) < 10 THEN 'short'
     WHEN TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, started_at, ended_at) BETWEEN 10 AND 20 THEN 'medium'
     ELSE 'long'
     END AS duration_cat,
   CASE
     WHEN rideable_type = 'classic_bike' AND member_casual = 'casual' AND TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, started_at, ended_at) < 10 THEN 'casual_classic_01'
	   WHEN rideable_type = 'classic_bike' AND member_casual = 'casual' AND TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, started_at, ended_at) BETWEEN 10 AND 20 THEN 'casual_classic_02'
     WHEN rideable_type = 'classic_bike' AND member_casual = 'casual' AND TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, started_at, ended_at) > 20 THEN 'casual_classic_03'
     WHEN rideable_type = 'electric_bike' AND member_casual = 'casual' AND TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, started_at, ended_at) < 10 THEN 'casual_electric_01'
	   WHEN rideable_type = 'electric_bike' AND member_casual = 'casual' AND TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, started_at, ended_at) BETWEEN 10 AND 20 THEN 'casual_electric_02'
     WHEN rideable_type = 'electric_bike' AND member_casual = 'casual' AND TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, started_at, ended_at) > 20 THEN 'casual_electric_03'
     WHEN rideable_type = 'classic_bike'  AND member_casual = 'member' AND TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, started_at, ended_at) < 10 THEN 'member_classic_01'
	   WHEN rideable_type = 'classic_bike' AND member_casual = 'member'  AND TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, started_at, ended_at) BETWEEN 10 AND 20 THEN 'member_classic_02'
     WHEN rideable_type = 'classic_bike' AND member_casual = 'member'  AND TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, started_at, ended_at) > 20 THEN 'member_classic_03'
     WHEN rideable_type = 'electric_bike' AND member_casual = 'member' AND TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, started_at, ended_at) < 10 THEN 'member_electric_01'
	   WHEN rideable_type = 'electric_bike' AND member_casual = 'member' AND TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, started_at, ended_at) BETWEEN 10 AND 20 THEN 'member_electric_02'
     ELSE 'member_electric_03'
       END AS member_cat
